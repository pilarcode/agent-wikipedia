It is the capital of the province of Alicante and a historic Mediterranean port.

The first tribes of hunter-gatherers moved down gradually from Central Europe between 5000 and 3000 BC. Some of the earliest settlements were made on the slopes of Mount Benacantil. By 1000 BC Greek and Phoenician traders had begun to visit the eastern coast of Spain, establishing small trading ports and introducing the native Iberian tribes to the alphabet, iron, and the pottery wheel. The Carthaginian general Hamilcar Barca established the fortified settlement of Akra Leuké (Greek: Ἄκρα Λευκή, meaning \"White Mountain\" or \"White Point\"), in the mid-230s BC, which is generally presumed to have been on the site of modern Alicante.\\n\\nAlthough the Carthaginians conquered much of the land around Alicante, the Romans would eventually rule Hispania Tarraconensis for over 700 years. By the 5th century AD, Rome was in decline and the Roman predecessor town of Alicante, known as Lucentum (Latin), was more or less under the control of the Visigothic warlord Theudimer and thereafter under Visigothic rule from 400 to 700 A.D. The Goths did not put up much resistance to the Arab conquest of Medina Laqant at the beginning of the 8th century. The Moors ruled southern and eastern Spain until the 13th century Reconquista (Reconquest). Alicante was conquered again in 1247 by the Castilian king Alfonso X, but later passed to the Kingdom of Valencia in 1296 with King James II of Aragon. It gained the status of Royal Village (Vila Reial) with representation in the medieval Valencian Parliament (Corts Valencianes).\\nAfter several decades of being the battlefield where the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon clashed, Alicante became a major Mediterranean trading station exporting rice, wine, olive oil, oranges, and wool. But between 1609 and 1614 King Felipe III expelled thousands of Moriscos who had remained in Valencia after the Reconquista, due to their cooperation with Barbary pirates who continually attacked coastal cities and caused much harm to trade. This act cost the region dearly; with so many skilled artisans and agricultural labourers gone, the feudal nobility found itself sliding into bankruptcy.\\nConditions worsened in the early 18th century; after the War of Spanish Succession, Alicante went into a long, slow decline, surviving through the 18th and 19th centuries by making shoes and growing agricultural produce such as oranges and almonds, and thanks to its fisheries. The end of the 19th century witnessed a sharp recovery of the local economy with increasing international trade and the growth of the city harbour leading to increased exports of several products (particularly during World War I when Spain was a neutral country).\\nDuring the early 20th century, Alicante was a minor capital that took profit from the benefit of Spain\\'s neutrality during World War I, and that provided new opportunities for local industry and agriculture. The Rif War in the 1920s saw numerous alicantinos drafted to fight in the long and bloody campaigns in the former Spanish protectorate (northern Morocco) against the Rif rebels. The political unrest of the late 1920s led to the victory of Republican candidates in local council elections throughout the country, and the abdication of King Alfonso XIII. The proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic was much celebrated in the city on 14 April 1931. The Spanish Civil War broke out on 17 July 1936.

The province is named after its capital, the city of Alicante.\\n\\n\\n== Territory, population and resources ==\\n\\nAccording to the 2018 population data, Alicante ranks as the fourth most populous province in Spain (after Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia), with 1,838,819 inhabitants. Cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants in the province are Alicante (334,757 inhabitants), Elche (230,112), Torrevieja (101,792), Orihuela (86,164), Benidorm (71,034), Alcoy (61,552), Elda (55,168), and San Vicente del Raspeig (53,126).\\nThe province has the largest ratio of foreigner population among all Spanish provinces. The total of 446,368 foreigners are registered in the province, which represents 23.6 percent of the total population.

All of these peaks are a part of the Subbaetic Range.\\nThe coast extends from the cape, Cap de la Nau, in the north to almost reaching the Mar Menor (Minor Sea) in the south. With regard to water sources, due to the dry rain regime there are no major rivers, but mostly ramblas (dry rivers), which fill in with water when torrential rains occur.\\nThe only remarkable streams are the Vinalopó, Serpis, and the river Segura. Other minor seasonal creeks (some completely dried out in summer) are Girona, Algar, Amadorio and Ebo.\\nThere are saline wetlands and marshlands along the coast such El Fondo and the former wetlands and now salt evaporation ponds in Santa Pola and Torrevieja. All of them are key Ramsar Sites which make the Alicante province of high relevance for both migratory and resident seabirds and waterbirds.\\nImportant coastal dunes are present in the Guardamar area which were planted with thousands of pine trees during the 19th century in order to protect the ville from the dunes advancing, which has created now an area of remarkable ecologic value.\\nThe climate is strikingly diverse for such a reduced area.

People also lived in the current municipality during the Bronze and Iron Ages. During the late Chalcolithic and the Bronze Age, the occupancy of part of the current municipality was performed by the Argaric people. During the late Bronze Age and the Iron Age, the people who inhabited the current municipality were the Iberians. A remarkable site is a religious building, whose name is the De la Luz Iberian Sanctuary. There are traces of people presence during the Roman rule in the Iberian Peninsula era. A construction of the late Roman period in the Iberian Peninsula is a fortress, Castillo de los Garres, located in the south of the northern half of the municipality.\\n\\nIt is widely believed that Murcia\\'s name is derived from the Latin word myrtea or murtea, meaning land of the myrtle (the plant is known to grow in the general area), although it may also be a derivation of the word Murtia, which would mean Murtius Village (Murtius was a common Roman name). Other research suggests that it may owe its name to the Latin Murtae (Mulberry), which covered the regional landscape for many centuries. The Latin name eventually changed into the Arabic Mursiya, and then, Murcia.\\nThe city in its present location was founded with the name Madinat Mursiyah (مدينة مرسية \\'city of Murcia\\') in AD 825 by Abd ar-Rahman II, who was then the emir of Córdoba. Umayyad planners, taking advantage of the course of the river Segura, created an imaginative and complex network of irrigation channels that made the town\\'s agricultural existence prosperous. In the 12th century the traveller and writer Muhammad al-Idrisi described the city of Murcia as populous and strongly fortified. After the fall of the Caliphate of Córdoba in 1031, Murcia passed under the successive rules of the powers seated variously at Almería and Toledo, but finally became capital of its own kingdom with Ibn Tahir (أبو عبد الرحمن بن طاهر). After the fall of the Almoravide empire, Ibn Mardanis made Murcia the capital of a new independent kingdom. At this time, Murcia was a very prosperous city, famous for its ceramics, exported to Italian towns, as well as for silk and paper industries, the first in Europe. The coinage of Murcia was considered as model in all the continent. The mystic Ibn Arabi (1165–1240) and the poet Ibn al-Jinan (d.1214) were born in Murcia during this period.\\n\\nIn 1172 Murcia was conquered by the north African Almohades, the last Muslim empire to rule southern Spain, and as the forces of the Christian Reconquista gained the upper hand, was the capital of a small Muslim emirate from 1223 to 1243.

The end of the 19th century witnessed a sharp recovery of the local economy with increasing international trade and the growth of the city harbour leading to increased exports of several products (particularly during World War I when Spain was a neutral country).\\\\nDuring the early 20th century, Alicante was a minor capital that took profit from the benefit of Spain\\\\\\'s neutrality during World War I, and that provided new opportunities for local industry and agriculture. The Rif War in the 1920s saw numerous alicantinos drafted to fight in the long and bloody campaigns in the former Spanish protectorate (northern Morocco) against the Rif rebels. The political unrest of the late 1920s led to the victory of Republican candidates in local council elections throughout the country, and the abdication of King Alfonso XIII. The proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic was much celebrated in the city on 14 April 1931. The Spanish Civil War broke out on 17 July 1936.

The province is named after its capital, the city of Alicante.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Territory, population and resources ==\\\\n\\\\nAccording to the 2018 population data, Alicante ranks as the fourth most populous province in Spain (after Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia), with 1,838,819 inhabitants. Cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants in the province are Alicante (334,757 inhabitants), Elche (230,112), Torrevieja (101,792), Orihuela (86,164), Benidorm (71,034), Alcoy (61,552), Elda (55,168), and San Vicente del Raspeig (53,126).\\\\nThe province has the largest ratio of foreigner population among all Spanish provinces. The total of 446,368 foreigners are registered in the province, which represents 23.6 percent of the total population.  Out of 141 municipalities that make up the province, foreign population is above 25% in 54 municipalities, and above 50% in 19 municipalities. The latter include San Fulgencio (80%), Rojales (74%), Benitatxell (69.8%), Algorfa (69.7%), Llíber (67%), Teulada (65.5%), Daya Vieja (64.4%); San Miguel de Salinas (64.3%), Calp (62.8%), Els Poblets (61.6%), Alcalalí (60.8%), Benijófar (58.5%), L\\'Alfàs del Pi (56.6%), Orba (55%), Xàbia (54%), Torrevieja (53.5%), Murla (52%), Fondó (51.7%), and Benidoleig (50%).\\\\nFrom the 50 provinces of Spain, Alicante is the only one with three metropolitan areas—Alicante–Elche, Elda–Petrer and Benidorm—even though only one of them (Alicante–Elche) is ranked within the Spanish top ten metropolitan areas. It has an area of 5,816.5 km2 (2,245.8 sq mi), and so it has a population density of 313.8 inhabitants/km2.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Geography and climate ===\\\\n\\\\nThe province is mountainous, especially in the north and midwest, whereas it is mostly flat to the south, in the Vega Baja del Segura area; the most elevated points in the province are Aitana (1,558 m), Puig Campana (1,410 m), Montcabrer (1,389 m), Carrascar de la Font Roja (1,354 m), Maigmó (1,296 m), Serra de Crevillent (835 m) and El Montgó (753 m). All of these peaks are a part of the Subbaetic Range.\\\\nThe coast extends from the cape, Cap de la Nau, in the north to almost reaching the Mar Menor (Minor Sea) in the south. With regard to water sources, due to the dry rain regime there are no major rivers, but mostly ramblas (dry rivers), which fill in with water when torrential rains occur.\\\\nThe only remarkable streams are the Vinalopó, Serpis, and the river Segura. Other minor seasonal creeks (some completely dried out in summer) are Girona, Algar, Amadorio and Ebo.\\\\nThere are saline wetlands and marshlands along the coast such El Fondo and the former wetlands and now salt evaporation ponds in Santa Pola and Torrevieja. All of them are key Ramsar Sites which make the Alicante province of high relevance for both migratory and resident seabirds and waterbirds.\\\\nImportant coastal dunes are present in the Guardamar area which were planted with thousands of pine trees during the 19th century in order to protect the ville from the dunes advancing, which has created now an area of remarkable ecologic value.\\\\nThe climate is strikingly diverse for such a reduced area. Three major areas can be cited:\\\\n\\\\nMost of the province belongs to a semi-arid climate. It roughly goes along the coastal plain from La Vila Joiosa through the southernmost border (cities included here are, amongst others, Alicante, Elche, Orihuela and Torrevieja).

People also lived in the current municipality during the Bronze and Iron Ages. During the late Chalcolithic and the Bronze Age, the occupancy of part of the current municipality was performed by the Argaric people. During the late Bronze Age and the Iron Age, the people who inhabited the current municipality were the Iberians. A remarkable site is a religious building, whose name is the De la Luz Iberian Sanctuary. There are traces of people presence during the Roman rule in the Iberian Peninsula era. A construction of the late Roman period in the Iberian Peninsula is a fortress, Castillo de los Garres, located in the south of the northern half of the municipality.\\\\n\\\\nIt is widely believed that Murcia\\\\\\'s name is derived from the Latin word myrtea or murtea, meaning land of the myrtle (the plant is known to grow in the general area), although it may also be a derivation of the word Murtia, which would mean Murtius Village (Murtius was a common Roman name). Other research suggests that it may owe its name to the Latin Murtae (Mulberry), which covered the regional landscape for many centuries. The Latin name eventually changed into the Arabic Mursiya, and then, Murcia.\\\\nThe city in its present location was founded with the name Madinat Mursiyah (مدينة مرسية \\\\\\'city of Murcia\\\\\\') in AD 825 by Abd ar-Rahman II, who was then the emir of Córdoba. Umayyad planners, taking advantage of the course of the river Segura, created an imaginative and complex network of irrigation channels that made the town\\\\\\'s agricultural existence prosperous. In the 12th century the traveller and writer Muhammad al-Idrisi described the city of Murcia as populous and strongly fortified. After the fall of the Caliphate of Córdoba in 1031, Murcia passed under the successive rules of the powers seated variously at Almería and Toledo, but finally became capital of its own kingdom with Ibn Tahir (أبو عبد الرحمن بن طاهر). After the fall of the Almoravide empire, Ibn Mardanis made Murcia the capital of a new independent kingdom. At this time, Murcia was a very prosperous city, famous for its ceramics, exported to Italian towns, as well as for silk and paper industries, the first in Europe. The coinage of Murcia was considered as model in all the continent. The mystic Ibn Arabi (1165–1240) and the poet Ibn al-Jinan (d.1214) were born in Murcia during this period.\\\\n\\\\nIn 1172 Murcia was conquered by the north African Almohades, the last Muslim empire to rule southern Spain, and as the forces of the Christian Reconquista gained the upper hand, was the capital of a small Muslim emirate from 1223 to 1243.

According to Francisco Cascales, it could refer to the Roman goddess Venus Murcia, from the myrtles on the banks of the Segura River.

Furthermore, Mursiya (already documented in the Islamic period as the name of the city of Murcia), was the adaptation in the Arabic of the pre-existing Latin. According to Bienvenido Mascaray, it is also possible that the name originates from the Iberian language in the form m-ur-zia, meaning \\\\\\'the water that empowers or moistens.\\\\\\'\\\\n\\\\nThe use of \"Murcia\" to define the present region has its origin in the Taifa of Murcia, an Arab kingdom that existed at different times in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries.

They subsequently formed the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF), holding their first meeting in 1913, joined by the Danish, German, Dutch, Russian, South African, and Swedish organizations. Voting rights were divided based on the perceived importance of the individual countries, with Great Britain\\'s Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) receiving the maximum six votes. Three tournaments were established, being designated as \"World Championships\":\\n\\nWorld Grass Court Championships, played on grass courts.\\nWorld Hard Court Championships, played on clay courts.\\nWorld Covered Court Championships, played on an indoor wood surface.\\nThe LTA was given the perpetual right to organize the World Grass Court Championships, to be held at Wimbledon, and France received permission to stage the World Hard Court Championships until 1916. Anthony Wilding of New Zealand won all three of these World Championships in 1913.\\nThe United States National Lawn Tennis Association (USNLTA) expressed disagreement over the power distribution within the ILTF and the designation of \"World Championship\" status to the British and French tournaments, and thus initially refused to join the Federation, choosing instead to be bystanders to their meetings. By the 1920s, with the World Covered Court Championships failing to attract top players and the growing success of American and Australian tennis, the ILTF worked to convince the USNLTA to join them, meeting their demand to drop the designation of \"World Championships\" from all three tournaments in March 1923, which led to the demise of both the World Covered Court Championships and the World Hard Court Championships. A new category of \"Official Championships\" was created for the national championships of Britain, France, Australia, and the US.

       "  Document(page_content='Grand Slam Tennis (known as Grand Chelem Tennis in France) is a tennis video game, developed by EA Canada, and released for the Wii in 2009. Versions for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 were planned to be released Autumn 2009, but they have been \"delayed indefinitely\". Instead, a sequel, Grand Slam Tennis 2, was released exclusively for those consoles in February 2012.\\nSome features for the Wii version include online play, Wii MotionPlus functionality, pick up and play, a Grand Slam career mode, and all four Grand Slam locations, including Wimbledon. The Wii version was also the first title in Europe to be bundled with the Wii MotionPlus.\\nThe in-game music was created by Paul van Dyk, who wrote and produced all the tracks in the game.\\n\\n\\n== Gameplay ==\\nGrand Slam Tennis features 23 total players, including 10 retired legends and 13 of today\\'s top players at the time of the game\\'s release. It also includes a \"Create-A-Player\" mode. In the \"Create-A-Player\" mode, players can create their own unique player for use in all modes of the game. The player can customize their created player with branded clothing, racquet styles, accessories and physical appearance. Up to nine players can be created at any one time. Pat Cash serves as the commentator even when he is playing in a match. Grand Slam Tennis offers 12 different authentic stadiums from all four Grand Slam venues to play in, and is the first video game since Top Spin 2 to feature a licensed Wimbledon.\\nPlay Now is a  mode allows players to enter either a singles or doubles match. This mode is available for both single and multiplayer forms of play. The player is able to select their venue, and to choose settings such as set length, number of sets, difficulty and the option of a tie-break.\\nGrand Slam mode allows players to embark on a career with their created player. The career involves travelling to each of the four Grand Slam tournaments and attempt to achieve the Grand Slam by winning every tournament. Each tournament begins with a warm-up match against a fellow fictional rookie of average ability. The player can then challenge a legend or current player to a match in an attempt to learn the players special ability, e.g. Rafael Nadal\\'s forehand topspin, or Björn Borg\\'s fitness. If the player is successful with their challenge, they may equip that special ability for use in future matches. The player can equip only one ability to start with, however as the player increases in skill, they will be able to equip multiple abilities at one time. Then the player will take part in a party style mini-game form of tennis along with fictional players, before starting the tournament. Every tournament starts at the round of 32 stage (round 3).\\nParty Mode is a collection of mini-games that are each a slightly altered form of tennis, with slight rule changes:\\n\\nTag Team: 2 on 2 with players rotating and taking turns hitting the ball.\\nAussie Doubles: 2 on 1 and the players rotate after each set.\\nDrop and Lob: use the drop shot and lob winners for double points.\\nChamps: time based game, take turns swinging, win the rally to become a champ.\\nKing of the Court: beat the king to become king, only the king earns points.\\nNet-masters: Net shots are worth double points.\\nTriplets: Similar to Aussie doubles where (2 on 1) but the players do not rotate around.\\nOnline multiplayer consists of ranked or unranked matches where you can play anyone around the world. Ranked earns the player points when they beat someone and these points decide what overall ranking you are in the world. Unranked matches are friendly and do not earn any points for the player\\'s online profile. It is good for people who are preparing to hit the leaderboards. When players win ranked matches they do not only win points for themselves but also for their country. There is a national leaderboard which shows which country has the best players.\\n\\n\\n== Reception ==\\n\\nGrand Slam Tennis received \"generally favorable reviews\" according to the rev', metadata={'title': 'Grand Slam Tennis', 'summary': 'Grand Slam Tennis (known as Grand Chelem Tennis in France) is a tennis video game, developed by EA Canada, and released for the Wii in 2009.

Versions for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 were planned to be released Autumn 2009, but they have been \"delayed indefinitely\". Instead, a sequel, Grand Slam Tennis 2, was released exclusively for those consoles in February 2012.\\\\nSome features for the Wii version include online play, Wii MotionPlus functionality, pick up and play, a Grand Slam career mode, and all four Grand Slam locations, including Wimbledon. The Wii version was also the first title in Europe to be bundled with the Wii MotionPlus.\\\\nThe in-game music was created by Paul van Dyk, who wrote and produced all the tracks in the game.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Gameplay ==\\\\nGrand Slam Tennis features 23 total players, including 10 retired legends and 13 of today\\\\\\'s top players at the time of the game\\\\\\'s release. It also includes a \"Create-A-Player\" mode. In the \"Create-A-Player\" mode, players can create their own unique player for use in all modes of the game. The player can customize their created player with branded clothing, racquet styles, accessories and physical appearance. Up to nine players can be created at any one time. Pat Cash serves as the commentator even when he is playing in a match. Grand Slam Tennis offers 12 different authentic stadiums from all four Grand Slam venues to play in, and is the first video game since Top Spin 2 to feature a licensed Wimbledon.\\\\nPlay Now is a  mode allows players to enter either a singles or doubles match. This mode is available for both single and multiplayer forms of play. The player is able to select their venue, and to choose settings such as set length, number of sets, difficulty and the option of a tie-break.\\\\nGrand Slam mode allows players to embark on a career with their created player. The career involves travelling to each of the four Grand Slam tournaments and attempt to achieve the Grand Slam by winning every tournament. Each tournament begins with a warm-up match against a fellow fictional rookie of average ability. The player can then challenge a legend or current player to a match in an attempt to learn the players special ability, e.g. Rafael Nadal\\\\\\'s forehand topspin, or Björn Borg\\\\\\'s fitness. If the player is successful with their challenge, they may equip that special ability for use in future matches. The player can equip only one ability to start with, however as the player increases in skill, they will be able to equip multiple abilities at one time. Then the player will take part in a party style mini-game form of tennis along with fictional players, before starting the tournament. Every tournament starts at the round of 32 stage (round 3).\\\\nParty Mode is a collection of mini-games that are each a slightly altered form of tennis, with slight rule changes:\\\\n\\\\nTag Team: 2 on 2 with players rotating and taking turns hitting the ball.\\\\nAussie Doubles: 2 on 1 and the players rotate after each set.\\\\nDrop and Lob: use the drop shot and lob winners for double points.\\\\nChamps: time based game, take turns swinging, win the rally to become a champ.\\\\nKing of the Court: beat the king to become king, only the king earns points.\\\\nNet-masters: Net shots are worth double points.\\\\nTriplets: Similar to Aussie doubles where (2 on 1) but the players do not rotate around.\\\\nOnline multiplayer consists of ranked or unranked matches where you can play anyone around the world. Ranked earns the player points when they beat someone and these points decide what overall ranking you are in the world. Unranked matches are friendly and do not earn any points for the player\\\\\\'s online profile. It is good for people who are preparing to hit the leaderboards. When players win ranked matches they do not only win points for themselves but also for their country. There is a national leaderboard which shows which country has the best players.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Reception ==\\\\n\\\\nGrand Slam Tennis received \"generally favorable reviews\" according to the rev\\' metadata={\\'title\\': \\'Grand Slam Tennis\\', \\'summary\\': \\'Grand Slam Tennis (known as Grand Chelem Tennis in France) is a tennis video game, developed by EA Canada, and released for the Wii in 2009.

They subsequently formed the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF), holding their first meeting in 1913, joined by the Danish, German, Dutch, Russian, South African, and Swedish organizations. Voting rights were divided based on the perceived importance of the individual countries, with Great Britain\\\\\\'s Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) receiving the maximum six votes.

Anthony Wilding of New Zealand won all three of these World Championships in 1913.\\\\nThe United States National Lawn Tennis Association (USNLTA) expressed disagreement over the power distribution within the ILTF and the designation of \"World Championship\" status to the British and French tournaments, and thus initially refused to join the Federation, choosing instead to be bystanders to their meetings. By the 1920s, with the World Covered Court Championships failing to attract top players and the growing success of American and Australian tennis, the ILTF worked to convince the USNLTA to join them, meeting their demand to drop the designation of \"World Championships\" from all three tournaments in March 1923, which led to the demise of both the World Covered Court Championships and the World Hard Court Championships. A new category of \"Official Championships\" was created for the national championships of Britain, France, Australia, and the US.

These have included the opening of the French national championships to international players in 1925, the elimination of the challenge round in 1922, and the admission of professional players in 1968 (the start of the Open Era).\\\\nAll of these tournaments have been listed based on the modern definition of a tennis major, rather than when they were officially recognized by the ILTF. The Grand Slam tournaments are the annual four major tennis events played in the Open Era, which began in 1968, superseding the Amateur Era. The Australian and U.S. tournaments were officially recognized by the ILTF in 1924, and the French Championships followed a year later in 1925 when it became open to all international players. The United States Lawn Tennis Association (USLTA) had several grievances with the ILTF and refused to join when it was formed in 1913.\\\\nFrom 1913 to 1923, there were three official championships recognized by the ILTF:\\\\n\\\\nWorld Grass Court Championships – Wimbledon.\\\\nWorld Hard Court Championships, held in Paris on clay courts.\\\\nWorld Covered Court Championships, held in Europe on an indoor wood surface.\\\\nDuring that same time period the USLTA recognized the U.S. National Championships\\\\n\\\\nU.S. National Championships, held in New York on grass.\\\\n\\\\n\\', \\'source\\': \\'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Grand_Slam_men%27s_singles_champions\\'}\\n</page_content>\\n</item>\\n<item index=\"2\">\\n<page_content>\\npage_content=\\'Grand Slam Tennis (known as Grand Chelem Tennis in France) is a tennis video game, developed by EA Canada, and released for the Wii in 2009. Versions for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 were planned to be released Autumn 2009, but they have been \"delayed indefinitely\". Instead, a sequel, Grand Slam Tennis 2, was released exclusively for those consoles in February 2012.\\\\nSome features for the Wii version include online play, Wii MotionPlus functionality, pick up and play, a Grand Slam career mode, and all four Grand Slam locations, including Wimbledon. The Wii version was also the first title in Europe to be bundled with the Wii MotionPlus.\\\\nThe in-game music was created by Paul van Dyk, who wrote and produced all the tracks in the game.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Gameplay ==\\\\nGrand Slam Tennis features 23 total players, including 10 retired legends and 13 of today\\\\\\'s top players at the time of the game\\\\\\'s release. It also includes a \"Create-A-Player\" mode. In the \"Create-A-Player\" mode, players can create their own unique player for use in all modes of the game. The player can customize their created player with branded clothing, racquet styles, accessories and physical appearance. Up to nine players can be created at any one time. Pat Cash serves as the commentator even when he is playing in a match. Grand Slam Tennis offers 12 different authentic stadiums from all four Grand Slam venues to play in, and is the first video game since Top Spin 2 to feature a licensed Wimbledon.\\\\nPlay Now is a  mode allows players to enter either a singles or doubles match. This mode is available for both single and multiplayer forms of play. The player is able to select their venue, and to choose settings such as set length, number of sets, difficulty and the option of a tie-break.\\\\nGrand Slam mode allows players to embark on a career with their created player. The career involves travelling to each of the four Grand Slam tournaments and attempt to achieve the Grand Slam by winning every tournament. Each tournament begins with a warm-up match against a fellow fictional rookie of average ability. The player can then challenge a legend or current player to a match in an attempt to learn the players special ability, e.g. Rafael Nadal\\\\\\'s forehand topspin, or Björn Borg\\\\\\'s fitness. If the player is successful with their challenge, they may equip that special ability for use in future matches. The player can equip only one ability to start with, however as the player increases in skill, they will be able to equip multiple abilities at one time. Then the player will take part in a party style mini-game form of tennis along with fictional players, before starting the tournament. Every tournament starts at the round of 32 stage (round 3).\\\\nParty Mode is a collection of mini-games that are each a slightly altered form of tennis, with slight rule changes:\\\\n\\\\nTag Team: 2 on 2 with players rotating and taking turns hitting the ball.\\\\nAussie Doubles: 2 on 1 and the players rotate after each set.\\\\nDrop and Lob: use the drop shot and lob winners for double points.\\\\nChamps: time based game, take turns swinging, win the rally to become a champ.\\\\nKing of the Court: beat the king to become king, only the king earns points.\\\\nNet-masters: Net shots are worth double points.\\\\nTriplets: Similar to Aussie doubles where (2 on 1) but the players do not rotate around.\\\\nOnline multiplayer consists of ranked or unranked matches where you can play anyone around the world. Ranked earns the player points when they beat someone and these points decide what overall ranking you are in the world. Unranked matches are friendly and do not earn any points for the player\\\\\\'s online profile. It is good for people who are preparing to hit the leaderboards. When players win ranked matches they do not only win points for themselves but also for their country. There is a national leaderboard which shows which country has the best players.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Reception ==\\\\n\\\\nGrand Slam Tennis received \"generally favorable reviews\" according to the rev\\' metadata={\\'title\\': \\'Grand Slam Tennis\\', \\'summary\\': \\'Grand Slam Tennis (known as Grand Chelem Tennis in France) is a tennis video game, developed by EA Canada, and released for the Wii in 2009.

The Australian and the United States tournaments are played on hard courts, the French on clay, and Wimbledon on grass. Wimbledon is the oldest tournament, founded in 1877, followed by the US in 1881, the French in 1891 (major in 1925), and the Australian in 1905, but it was not until 1925 that all four were held as officially sanctioned majors.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== History ==\\\\n\\\\nWith the growing popularity of tennis, and with the hopes of unifying the sport\\\\\\'s rules internationally, the British and French tennis associations started discussions at their Davis Cup tie, and in October 1912 organized a meeting in Paris, joined by the Australasian, Austrian, Belgian, Spanish, and Swiss associations. They subsequently formed the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF), holding their first meeting in 1913, joined by the Danish, German, Dutch, Russian, South African, and Swedish organizations. Voting rights were divided based on the perceived importance of the individual countries, with Great Britain\\\\\\'s Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) receiving the maximum six votes. Three tournaments were established, being designated as \"World Championships\":\\\\n\\\\nWorld Grass Court Championships, played on grass courts.\\\\nWorld Hard Court Championships, played on clay courts.\\\\nWorld Covered Court Championships, played on an indoor wood surface.\\\\nThe LTA was given the perpetual right to organize the World Grass Court Championships, to be held at Wimbledon, and France received permission to stage the World Hard Court Championships until 1916. Anthony Wilding of New Zealand won all three of these World Championships in 1913.\\\\nThe United States National Lawn Tennis Association (USNLTA) expressed disagreement over the power distribution within the ILTF and the designation of \"World Championship\" status to the British and French tournaments, and thus initially refused to join the Federation, choosing instead to be bystanders to their meetings. By the 1920s, with the World Covered Court Championships failing to attract top players and the growing success of American and Australian tennis, the ILTF worked to convince the USNLTA to join them, meeting their demand to drop the designation of \"World Championships\" from all three tournaments in March 1923, which led to the demise of both the World Covered Court Championships and the World Hard Court Championships. A new category of \"Official Championships\" was created for the national championships of Britain, France, Australia, and the US. By the 1930s, these four tournaments had become well defined as the most prestigious in the sport.\\\\nIn 1933, Jack Crawford won the Australian, French, and Wimbledon Championships, lea\\' metadata={\\'title\\': \\'Grand Slam (tennis)\\', \\'summary\\': \\'The Grand Slam in tennis is the achievement of winning all four major championships in one discipline in a calendar year.
